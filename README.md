# dungeon-crawler

Dungeon crawler simulates text-based dungeon crawlers where the dungeon is represented by symbols from the keyboard. Each dungeon level is stored as a dynamic 2D array in C++ and is repeatedly updated when necessary. Monsters track towards the player as they play, coins can be collected, treasure, and gems. Gems expand the current 2D array size.
